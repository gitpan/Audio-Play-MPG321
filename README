Audio-Play-MPG321 version 0.003
===============================

Audio::Play::MPG321 is an interface to the MPG321 MP3 player. You will need
mpg321 (version 0.2.10 or beyond is recommended.) and of course a *nix
platform, since to my knowledge mpg321 doesn't have many ports on non-*nix
platforms.

You may want to check out Audio::Daemon::MPG321, which slaps a song queue
around A::P::M. If it's not on a CPAN mirror near you yet, it will be soon.

Please read the POD documentation contained within the module and send fixes,
comments, and suggestions to <scarlino@bellsouth.net>. Have fun!

INSTALLATION

To install this module, type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

(But you really shouldn't have to if you had any sense and were using an
automated CPAN tool for installation.)

DEPENDENCIES

  Audio::Play::MPG321 requires the MPG321 player. This module is tested on
  version 0.2.10, but earlier or later versions should work.
