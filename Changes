Revision history for Perl extension Audio::Play::MPG321.

0.001  Fri May 27 15:38:48 2005
	- The original version; seems to be pretty stable.

0.002  Sat May 28 11:55::05 2005
	- I forgot to take the bit out of the documentation that said a
	  non-standard MPG321 player is needed; I fixed the module so the
	  standard can be used. The example in the synopsis should work fine
	  (And therefore the entire module, in theory) provided you change the
	  two filenames to real MP3s.
